        <div class="williams-bio">Eons ago a baby named William was born under a full moon amidst the first spring harvest. Due to an abnormal and luxurious volume of flowing midnight black hair he was hailed as a god amongst his people. With his known universe in the palm of his tiny hands, he went forth into the world to forge his path.
          As the years rolled on civilizations and societies crumbled to his will…
          Until the two thousand and nineteenth year of Anno Domini…
        After growing increasingly fatigued by his role in society he plotted a move to the manipulation and creation of computational programs. As he filled out the paperwork to apply himself to a new society dubbed Code Fellows, he accidentally added an ’s’ to his name. Thus…Williams the Code Fellows software developer in training was reborn.</div>
