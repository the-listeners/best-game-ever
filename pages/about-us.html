        <p id="williamsInfo" style = "display: none">Eons ago a baby named William was born under a full moon amidst the first spring harvest. Due to an abnormal and luxurious volume of flowing midnight black hair he was hailed as a god amongst his people. With his known universe in the palm of his tiny hands, he went forth into the world to forge his path.<br>
        
        <br>As the years rolled on civilizations and societies crumbled to his will…<br>
        
        <br>Until the two thousand and nineteenth year of Anno Domini…<br>
        
        <br>After growing increasingly fatigued by his role in society he plotted a move to the manipulation and creation of computational programs. As he filled out the paperwork to apply himself to a new society dubbed Code Fellows, he accidentally added an ’s’ to his name. Thus…Williams the Code Fellows software developer in training was reborn.</p> 

        <p id="pratiibhInfo" style = "display: none">On one particularly pristine autumn day Pratiibh found himself traversing a vibrant section of untouched woodland. He decided to take a moment to bask in the golden beams of sunshine dancing through the soft blue afternoon sky.<br>

        <br>In the blink of an eye he found himself shrouded in darkness. Furious storm clouds blotted out the sun and a tempest began to stir around him. A solitary strike of arterial lightning cracked the storm wide open and a flash of lightning struck the crown of his head. In an instant the world around him snapped shut.<br>

        <br>Weeks later he awoke in an alternate universe in a location called the Ada Lovelace classroom. Initially confused, he found he was enamored with the course material and although he missed his home universe, he made his peace in being given an opportunity to entertain his new passion. </p>

        <p id="melissaInfo" style = "display: none">After being relentlessly trained in hand to hand combat and thoroughly versed in arts and sciences, Melissa was hailed as a once-in-a-generation level prodigy. The remote island fortress where she was raised was ruthless, and yet, Melissa found herself effortlessly surpassing her mentors and masters.<br>

        <br>Barely on the cusp of adulthood, she left all that she had known in a quest for a true challenge.  After years of disappointment and on the verge of hopelessness, she placed her foot upon the concrete gray floor of the Code Fellows offices in the 3rd and Broad Building in Seattle, WA. Her skepticism was met head on by the full force of intermediate level JavaScript. Tears of joy flooded her eyes as she had truly found a challenge worthy of her gifts.<br>
        
        <br>Feeling inspired, she submitted her application towards a bright and hopeful future in software engineering.</p>

        <p id="joannaInfo" style = "display: none">Joanna believed wholeheartedly in the law until the law stopped returning the favor. On one fateful starry night, Joanna decided on a dockside stroll along the local waterfront. Her hand moved to her bag to retrieve her favorite pineapple lumps that she had packed before leaving her apartment hours earlier. As her fingers clasped empty space in her bag, her heart sunk. Her pineapple lumps were gone. Her eyes paced the wooden planks of the dock, desperate to find the heartless thief.<br>

        <br>Seemingly out of thin air a small child trotted by holding a half opened wrapper of pineapple lumps.<br>

        <br>“Give those back!” Joanna cried.<br>

        <br>The sweet and bitter aroma of stolen pineapple lumps clung to the child’s words as he said, “Finders keepers, lame-o!”<br>

        <br>In a frenzy Joanna called to a nearby police officer to arrest the child. The officer merely turned his back and pretended to see nothing.<br>

        <br>Joanna had given years of her blood sweat and tears toward upholding and defending the law, and yet, it had betrayed her.<br>
        <br>The next morning she made her way back to the docks, only this time she boarded a boat to Seattle, WA. The duration of the journey was spent researching a career change and the choice was simple. She would pursue software development.</p>

        <p id="denevanInfo" style = "display: none">In the magi age, those who possessed forbidden magic, ruled the world. Villages and citizens of powerful nations suffered and bent to the will of these magicians, commonly referred to as blight mages. Groups of these mages began to band together in an effort to dominate regions and, ultimately, the world. Most prominent was a group named The Esqool. They ruthlessly harvested innocent souls to fuel their own magic.<br>

        <br>One day they stumbled upon a seemingly insignificant village named Dene. To the bewilderment of the Esqool, the villagers were nonplussed at the sight of mages and carried on with their day. The Esqool were not accustomed to having to work up fear and intimidation. This was something that had come naturally to them for hundreds of years now. The Esqool began threatening horrific pain and misery upon the villagers if their presence continued to be ignored.<br>

        <br>“Wut..?” Said the Dene people with blank looks upon their face.<br>

        <br>The Esqool deliberated amongst themselves and they were certain. These people were literal fools. Each and every one of them.<br>

        <br>Suddenly the Esqool’s robes began pluming burgundy smoke and their bodies began to dissolve. After years of near invincibility, this village of fools had revealed their greatest secret…<br>

        <br>Without fear, the Esqool were nothing. In a last ditch effort, the Esqool used their remaining power to perform a spell that would bind the Dene fools into one body and cast them millennia into the future.<br>

        <br>Many years later a boy named Denevan came to consciousness. One being with the power of a village of idiots. He stumbled his way through life until one day determining that with the combined intelligence of all the villagers he was just barely capable of learning computer programming. He enrolled at Code Fellows a few days later.<br>
