What is your process to resolve conflicts?
Communication and voting.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

# Communication Plan
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Everyone agrees to use Slack and communicate anytime and do our best to reply.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard?
- Everyone agrees to speak up and do their best to speak in-person where possible, depending on their comfort level. 
- If we have major decisions, make sure everyone gets a say before a decision is made.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Stay positive, open-minded, willing to talk 
Not assigning blame, but fixing the process so that mistakes are caught and fixed by the team
